h1. Jekyll Scaffold

I made a few websites lately. For generating the static HTML i used "Jekyll":http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/ which i really like. But to save oneself to do the same steps again and again i made me this little scaffold.

h2. Usage

# Clone this repository.
@git clone git://github.com/pattex/jekyll_scaffold.git my_site@
# Edit @_config.yml@ like you want it to be.
# Let Jekyll do the work for you and check if everything is well done.
@cd my_site
jekyll --server@
# Do your changes, like replacing the dummy posts with some more impressive stuff and adding a beautiful design.
